# Documentation Restructuring Summary

## Changes Made

The MultiFlexMeter V3 documentation has been restructured from a basic two-folder structure (guides/ + reference/) to a comprehensive professional documentation system.

### ‚úÖ Completed Changes

#### 1. **Corrected Technology Stack**
- ‚ùå Removed incorrect Python references
- ‚úÖ Emphasized C++ with Arduino Framework
- ‚úÖ Highlighted PlatformIO as the build system
- ‚úÖ Added firmware technology stack section to landing page

#### 2. **New Folder Structure**

Replaced old structure:
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guides/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ reference/
```

With professional organization:
```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ overview/          # High-level introduction and architecture
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hardware/          # Hardware specs, schematics, pinouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ firmware/          # Firmware architecture, protocol, API
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/        # Quick start, configuration, TTN setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development/       # Dev environment, contributing, extending
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ troubleshooting/   # Common issues, debugging, FAQ
```

#### 3. **New Documentation Pages Created**

**Overview Section:**
- `overview/introduction.md` - Complete project introduction with use cases
- `overview/features.md` - Detailed feature list and capabilities
- `overview/architecture.md` - Full C4 architecture documentation (corrected, no Python)

**Deployment Section:**
- `deployment/quick-start.md` - Step-by-step getting started guide with correct C++ tooling

#### 4. **Updated Navigation**

`astro.config.mjs` now has 6 main sections:
1. Overview (3 pages)
2. Hardware (4 pages planned)
3. Firmware (4 pages planned)
4. Deployment (4 pages planned)
5. Development (4 pages planned)
6. Troubleshooting (3 pages planned)

#### 5. **Landing Page Improvements**
- Added "Firmware Technology Stack" section
- Emphasized C++/PlatformIO clearly
- Added tip box: "No Python Required"
- Updated quick links to new structure
- Better visual organization with card grids

### üìã Still To Do

#### Hardware Section
- [ ] `hardware/overview.md` - Hardware introduction
- [ ] `hardware/specifications.md` - Full technical specs
- [ ] `hardware/pinout.md` - Detailed pin mappings
- [ ] `hardware/schematics.md` - Link to KiCad files and images

#### Firmware Section
- [ ] `firmware/architecture.md` - Firmware-specific architecture
- [ ] `firmware/protocol.md` - Move from reference/, remove Python config examples
- [ ] `firmware/api-reference.md` - Move from reference/api.md
- [ ] `firmware/build-system.md` - PlatformIO configuration details

#### Deployment Section
- [ ] `deployment/configuration.md` - Move from guides/, fix Python script references
- [ ] `deployment/ttn-setup.md` - Detailed TTN configuration
- [ ] `deployment/field-deployment.md` - Best practices for real deployments

#### Development Section
- [ ] `development/environment-setup.md` - PlatformIO, VS Code setup
- [ ] `development/development-guide.md` - Building, flashing, debugging
- [ ] `development/adding-sensors.md` - How to add new sensor drivers
- [ ] `development/contributing.md` - Contribution guidelines

#### Troubleshooting Section
- [ ] `troubleshooting/common-issues.md` - FAQ-style common problems
- [ ] `troubleshooting/debugging.md` - Debug techniques and tools
- [ ] `troubleshooting/faq.md` - Frequently asked questions

### Migration Tasks

#### Move and Fix Existing Content
- [ ] Move `guides/configuration.md` ‚Üí `deployment/configuration.md`
  - Remove Python EEPROM script
  - Add C++ configuration methods or keep as reference
- [ ] Move `reference/protocol.md` ‚Üí `firmware/protocol.md`
- [ ] Move `reference/hardware.md` ‚Üí Split into `hardware/` pages
- [ ] Move `reference/api.md` ‚Üí `firmware/api-reference.md`
- [ ] Delete old `guides/` and `reference/` folders

### Key Corrections Made

1. **Technology Stack**: Clearly stated as C++ PlatformIO project, not Python
2. **Build System**: PlatformIO emphasized throughout
3. **Development Tools**: VS Code + PlatformIO extension
4. **No Python Confusion**: Added explicit callout that Python is not required
5. **Professional Structure**: Following industry best practices (similar to Atlassian example)

### Benefits of New Structure

‚úÖ **Better Organization**: Logical grouping by user journey
‚úÖ **Scalability**: Easy to add new pages in appropriate sections
‚úÖ **User-Friendly**: Clear path from beginner to advanced
‚úÖ **Professional**: Matches industry-standard documentation patterns
‚úÖ **Correct Information**: No misleading technology references

### Next Steps

1. Create remaining placeholder pages
2. Migrate existing content from guides/ and reference/
3. Remove Python configuration examples or clarify they're helper scripts
4. Add hardware schematics and images
5. Test all internal links
6. Delete old folder structure

## Testing

To test the new structure:

```bash
cd MFM-docs
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:4321` and verify:
- New navigation structure works
- All created pages render correctly
- No broken links in created pages
- Landing page shows correct information
